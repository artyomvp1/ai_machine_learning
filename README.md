# GOALS
**Python** is the main programming language for AI models. It serves as the backbone for most of the development, training, and deployment processes due to its versatility, extensive library ecosystem, and ease of use in AI and machine learning tasks.

**Rich Libraries:**  
*Python has robust libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers, which are essential for building and deploying deep learning models.*  

**Ease of Use:**  
*Python's simplicity and readability make it ideal for implementing complex algorithms and experimenting during model development.*  

**Community Support:**  
*A large, active community ensures abundant resources, frameworks, and tools for AI research and development.*  

**Integration:**  
*Python integrates seamlessly with other languages (e.g., C++ for performance-critical operations and CUDA for GPU acceleration).*
